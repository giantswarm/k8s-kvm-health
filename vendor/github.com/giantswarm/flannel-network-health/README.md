### How to build

#### Dependencies

Dependencies are managed using [`glide`](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and contained in the `vendor` directory. See `glide.yaml` for a list of libraries this project directly depends on and `glide.lock` for complete information on all external libraries and their versions used.

**Note:** The `vendor` directory is **flattened**. Always use the `--strip-vendor` (or `-v`) flag when working with `glide`.

#### Building the standard way

```nohighlight
go build
```

#### Cross-compiling in a container

Here goes the documentation on compiling for different architectures from inside a Docker container.
